## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.0] - 2024-04-17

### Features

* Added hints to some health check outputs to help users resolve potential issues. (09e0860)
* New health check for NVMe-oF resource agents. (d3441f5)
* New health check for SCST kernel modules and user space utilities. (138c1f6)
* The drbd-reactor health check now also checks that if the `drbd-reactor-reload.{path,service}` files are up-to-date. (2c40ff0)
* When creating a resource, linstor-gateway now waits a few seconds to ensure that the resource is actually running. This prevents situations where the resource fails to start, but linstor-gateway still reports it as "running". (2c40ff0)
* Various improvements to the end-to-end tests.

## [1.4.0] - 2024-03-04

* No changes over rc1

## [1.4.0-rc.1] - 2024-02-20

### Features

* The `nfs create` command now supports creating multiple NFS exports in the same cluster. (6244defb)
* The `delete` command now prompts for confirmation before deleting a resource. (7c6d7833)
* drbd-reactor configuration files generated by LINSTOR Gateway are now versioned and can be migrated to new versions automatically. (87230226, f72c2c39)

### Fixes

* The `nfs upgrade` command now actually respects the `--dry-run` flag. (e760b419)
* drbd-reactor configuration files no longer include the deprecated `id` field. (878d53f4)
* In the NFS configuration file, the `IPaddr2` and `nfsserver` resource agent entries were switched. These are now in the correct order. (2337e327)

## [1.3.0] - 2023-10-24

* No changes over rc1

## [1.3.0-rc.1] - 2023-10-16

### Features

* The `status` command will now show what node a resource is running on. (106dfc88)
* The `check-health` command now differentiates between "agent", "server", and "client" mode, checking the requirements for the respective mode of operation. (e0b25072)
* All `create` commands now use `-r` as the shorthand flag for resource groups. Previously, iSCSI used `-g` instead -- this shorthand is now deprecated. (5b0eb9ab)
* When creating an iSCSI target, the `--implementation` flag can now be used to specify what iSCSI target implementation should be used by the underlying resource agent. (e6bcc14f)
* When a step in the creation of a resource fails, the resources created in previous steps will now be cleaned up. This avoids "resource already exists" errors. (434d2d13)
* When installing LINSTOR Gateway via rpm, the drbd-reactor auto-reload files will now be copied to the appropriate place automatically. (736cd2ae)

### Fixes

* The `check-health` command now finds the correct path to the drbd-reactor documentation directory more reliably. (bc4747ac)

## [1.2.0] - 2023-03-14

### Features

* When creating a resource (iSCSI, NVMe-oF, or NFS), LINSTOR Gateway will now do a basic check for IP collisions. If the provided service IP is already in use by another resource, an error will be thrown. (48ac8502)

### Fixes

* The CLI will no longer print the usage information whenever an error happens. (4e2cc19c)
* When listing resources, degraded resources could previously be displayed twice. This was changed so that every resource only gets reported once. (a4b56ceb)
* Remove a check that verifies a resource is stopped before adding a volume. Adding volumes works just as well on running resources. (8426c36e)

## [1.1.1] - 2023-03-06

### Fixes

* Fix NFS healthcheck on older systemd versions (53bbd671)
* Ignore and overwrite an existing promoter config if its corresponding
  LINSTOR resource does not exist (137f7560)
* Fix a `nil` dereference when listing resources with a broken LINSTOR state
  (df53d0b3)

## [1.1.0] - 2023-02-24

### Features

* Extend the health check for NFS: it is now verified that the `nfs-server` package is actually installed.
