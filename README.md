# LINSTOR Gateway

LINSTOR Gateway manages highly available iSCSI targets, NFS exports, and NVMe-oF
targets by leveraging [LINSTOR](https://github.com/LINBIT/linstor-server) and
[drbd-reactor](https://github.com/LINBIT/drbd-reactor). A working LINSTOR cluster
with drbd-reactor are a prerequisite to use this tool.

# Quick Start

1. Set up a [LINSTOR](https://github.com/LINBIT/linstor-server) cluster. Ensure
   you have a [storage pool](https://linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/linstor-guide-1_0-en/#s-storage_pools)
   as well as a [resource group](https://linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/linstor-guide-1_0-en/#s-linstor-resource-groups)
   for your data.
2. Set up [drbd-reactor](https://github.com/LINBIT/drbd-reactor). The daemon
   should be configured to reload automatically when the configuration changes â€“ follow
   the steps from the [drbd-reactor README](https://github.com/LINBIT/drbd-reactor/#automatic-reload).
3. LINSTOR Gateway is packaged as a single binary. Download one of the
   [releases](https://github.com/LINBIT/linstor-gateway/releases), put it
   into `/usr/local/bin`, and you are ready to go.

# Requirements

LINSTOR Gateway provides a built-in health check that automatically tests
whether all requirements are correctly met on the current host.

Simply execute

```
linstor-gateway check-health
```

and follow any suggestions that may come up.
