LINSTOR Gateway manages highly available **iSCSI targets**, **NFS exports**, and
**NVMe-oF targets** by leveraging [LINSTOR](https://github.com/LINBIT/linstor-server)
and [drbd-reactor](https://github.com/LINBIT/drbd-reactor).

# Getting Started

For a step-by-step tutorial on setting up a LINSTOR Gateway cluster, refer to

# Requirements

LINSTOR Gateway provides a built-in health check that automatically tests whether all requirements are correctly met on
the current host.

Simply execute

```
linstor-gateway check-health
```

and follow any suggestions that may come up.
