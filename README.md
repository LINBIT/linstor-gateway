LINSTOR Gateway manages highly available **iSCSI targets**, **NFS exports**, and
**NVMe-oF targets** by leveraging [LINSTOR](https://github.com/LINBIT/linstor-server)
and [drbd-reactor](https://github.com/LINBIT/drbd-reactor).

# Quick Start

1. Set up a [LINSTOR](https://github.com/LINBIT/linstor-server) cluster. Ensure you have
   a [storage pool](https://linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/linstor-guide-1_0-en/#s-storage_pools) with enough space for your
   data.
2. Set up [drbd-reactor](https://github.com/LINBIT/drbd-reactor). The daemon should be configured to reload
   automatically when the configuration changes â€“ follow the steps from
   the [drbd-reactor README](https://github.com/LINBIT/drbd-reactor/#automatic-reload).
3. LINSTOR Gateway is packaged as a single binary. Download one of the
   [releases](https://github.com/LINBIT/linstor-gateway/releases) and copy it to `/usr/local/bin`.
4. Start the LINSTOR Gateway server:
   ```
   linstor-gateway server
   ```
   This repository also includes [linstor-gateway.service](./linstor-gateway.service)
   which can be used to start the server via systemd.

# Requirements

LINSTOR Gateway provides a built-in health check that automatically tests whether all requirements are correctly met on
the current host.

Simply execute

```
linstor-gateway check-health
```

and follow any suggestions that may come up.

It also exposes a Go client for the REST
API: <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/LINBIT/linstor-gateway/client"><img src="https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/LINBIT/linstor-gateway/client.svg" alt="Go Reference"></a>
