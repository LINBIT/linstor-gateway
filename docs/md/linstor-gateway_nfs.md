## linstor-gateway nfs

Manages Highly-Available NFS exports

### Synopsis

linstor-gateway nfs manages highly available NFS exports by leveraging LINSTOR
and drbd-reactor. A running LINSTOR cluster including storage pools and resource groups
is a prerequisite to use this tool.

NOTE that, currently, only one NFS export can exist in a cluster.
See "help nfs create" for more information

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for nfs
```

  -c, --connect string    LINSTOR Gateway server to connect to (default "http://localhost:8080")
